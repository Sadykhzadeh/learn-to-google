					Please, learn to google!

			</h1>
			<p>Don't ask questions in chats/forums like:</p>
			<div class="dialog-line -you">
				<div class="content">
					Why do we need inheritance?
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="dialog-line -you">
				<div class="content">
					Why is the sky blue?
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="dialog-line -you">
				<div class="content">
					What is polymorphism?
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>These kinds of questions you <s>can</s> should <b>google</b> first!</p>
			<p><b>To google</b> means:
				<ol>
					<li>Открыть
							<a target = "_blank" href = "https://google.com">Google</a>
						(or other search engine)
					</li>
					<li>Enter your request.</li>
				</ol>

			<p class="quote"> - I saw, but what's wrong with that I ask these questions in chats/forums?</p>
			<p> - Believe me, 99% of your questions someone asked in forum a long time ago. This means that the answer is in the Internet. Therefore, asking a question to Google (or other search engine), you not only will get quick response, but also will not be disturbing other people.</p>
			<p class="quote">- So, is asking questions in the chat/forums prohibited/unethical/bad?</p>
			<p>Not really. If you have a question, first Google it, then if you can't find the answer, you can 
				<s>search it in
					<a target = "_blank" href = "https://yandex.com">Yandex</a>
				</s> ask your question in forum.</p>
