# "Learn to Google" website

[Russian](https://sadykhzadeh.github.io/learn-to-google/) | [English](https://sadykhzadeh.github.io/learn-to-google/en/) | [Azerbaijani](https://sadykhzadeh.github.io/learn-to-google/az/) | [Ukrainian](https://sadykhzadeh.github.io/learn-to-google/ua/)

The main purpose of the site is to explain the advantages of googling questions in a polite way to people who are too lazy to Google for unknown reasons.

*The code has NOT been polished and is provided "as is". There are a lot of code that are redundant and there are tons of improvements that can be made.*
